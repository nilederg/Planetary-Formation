  1. Spherical perlin noise
use 3d noise and cut to sphere
  2. Tectonic plates
randomly divide and randomly assign velocity. remember to generate more plate matter on separations + volcanoes
  3. Add fractal perlin noise
similar to stage 1 but with many different scales
  4.5. Materials
add in different materials, determined by fractal noise
  4. Meteors
start by deciding the impact point on the sphere, then pick a point on a hemisphere with a plane tangent to the sphere to initiate the meteor. Simulate collision using particle scaling and lock the majority of the planet as a heightmap unless more simulation area is needed. Alter local material composition with meteor contents.
  5. Weather, river erosion
i have no idea
                            OPTIONAL CHALLENGES
  1A. Weather simulation
simulate weather patterns based on terrain to increase erosion accuracy
  1B. Biomes
use weather simulation and terrain features like roughness, height, etc to create biomes. These will enhance rendering, and will erode differently
  1C. Simulate different minerals and their travel
this will be difficult. To do this, create a planetary formation stage and begin simulation of the mantle as well.
  0. Compression
similar to flac audio compression, use polynomial approximation and possible sinusoidal regression to compress terrain lossily. use 10m res and ai enhance :)
  0.1. Materials Compression
Mantle materials can be stored as one ratio,
